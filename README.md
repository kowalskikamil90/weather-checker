# weather-checker
This is a GUI application that can be used to check the weather in a specified place in the world. It uses the REST api of a well-known web service (https://openweathermap.org/). The application was developed on Ubuntu using Qt Creator. It may be run on Linux, Windows, Mac without any modifications, but it needs to be compiled from the source code.
